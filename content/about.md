## About Me

Hi, my name is **Fatos Shala** â€” proud **dad** and IT Security Engineer.
I started out as a polymechanic, but my real passion has always been IT.
Over time, this passion turned into a career as an *IT Security Engineer*.
My long-term goal: moving deeper into **pentesting and red teaming**.

One step on this path is solving challenges on **TryHackMe** and **HackTheBox**.
While doing these, I began writing **detailed writeups** â€” not just the final solutions, but also my thought process, mistakes, and rabbit holes along the way. I want to show that itâ€™s normal to get stuck or take the long route.

This blog is my space to document what I learn, explore different topics, and share insights â€” whether in cybersecurity, coding, or other areas that spark my curiosity.

## Who I Am

Iâ€™m curious, detail-oriented, and maybe a bit stubborn when it comes to solving problems.
Technology fascinates me â€” my daily drivers are a **MacBook Air M3** and an **iMac late 2015**, but I also love tinkering with **Arch Linux**, which still powers my home server.

Why MacOS?
Because while Linux gave me endless freedom, I often ended up customizing the system instead of using it. MacOS is the right balance for me: reliable, efficient, and still close enough to Unix to feel like home.

Outside of tech, I enjoy:

- Riding and working on motorcycles (currently a [Harley FXDLS 2016](https://womanrider.com/2016/05/2016-harley-davidson-fxdls-low-rider-s-press-launch-unleashing-the-beast/)).
- Practicing **Krav Maga** and staying active in sports.
- Exploring great stories â€” whether in movies, anime, manga, or books.

Some of my all-time favorites include *Ghost in the Shell (1995)*, *Interstellar*, and *The Buried Giant* by Kazuo Ishiguro.

## Why This Blog

I write because I enjoy **sharing knowledge** and because I know how helpful detailed explanations can be. My goal is that at least one person finds value in my writeups, learns something new, or simply feels less alone when getting lost in rabbit holes.

Thanks for reading â€” and welcome to my blog ðŸš€
