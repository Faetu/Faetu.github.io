Hi,

This is my writeup about the [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) medium box ["Boiler CTF"](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/boilerctf2).

## 0. Enumeration

I start with nmap and get a first look at the machine:

```bash
nmap -Pn -p- $target -oN ports
```
{: .nolineno}

This scan reveals four open ports. To get more of them, I run a second scan:
```bash
nmap -Pn -sC -sV -p (grep -Po '[0-9]*(?=/tcp)' ./ports | tr '\n' ', ') $target -oN services
```
{: .nolineno}

Many interesting results.

![nmap services dark](/assets/images/boilerctf/nmap_services_dark.png){: .dark .w-75 .shadow}

I will proceed by questions order now.

# Questions #1

## 1. File extension after anon login

The "anon login" phrase in the question refers to the [anonymous ftp login](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-ftp#anonymous-login).
As seen in the screenshot of the nmap service scan, anonymous login is allowed:
```
|_ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
```
{: .nolineno}

I logged in as anonymous user:
```bash
ftp $target
```
{: .nolineno}

When prompted for a Name, write "anonymous" and hit enter. Now after successful login as anonymous user, I ran `ls -a` to see whats on the ftp server. The `-a` flag is useful, because there could always be a hidden file.
There is only one hidden file and the extension of that file is the answer to the question.

Don't forget to download the file to your system with the `get FILE` command. It has a nice funny message for us.
But it is not relevant for solving the questions.

## 2. What is on the highest port?

For this question, just take a look at the nmap service scan results.

## 3. What's running on port 10000?

Same here.

## 4. Can you exploit the service running on that port?

The question is referring to the port 10'000. Where `webmin` at version `1.93` is running.
I ran [searchsploit]() providing the version and service. The answer to this question is obvious.

![searchsploit result webmin light](/assets/images/boilerctf/exploits_webmin_light.png){: .light .w-75 .shadow}
![searchsploit result webmin dark](/assets/images/boilerctf/exploits_webmin_dark.png){: .dark .w-75 .shadow}

## 5. What's CMS can you access?

So far I've done just nmap scan for services and I only know those ports and services running on them. Because I could not found any hint on those informations to answer the question, I ran a [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) to find any directory.

Running it on port 10'000 was a waste of time. But I though this could be the way to go. After that, I ran the scan against the 80 port.

```bash
gobuster dir -u "http://$target" -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o dirs
```
{: .nolineno}

I like the wordlist used here, because it takes not long to process but is enough for most CTF-like boxes.

![gobuster dir scan light](/assets/images/boilerctf/gobuster_result_light.png){: .light .w-100}
![gobuster dir scan dark](/assets/images/boilerctf/gobuster_result_dark.png){: .dark .w-100}

## 6. Keep enumerating, you'll know when you find it.

Not a question which can be answered but a good hint to solve the next one.
I understand this that way, that I have to continue on the founding before with gobuster and enumerate further.

I used more than five wordlists just to be safe, that I'm not missing something and there it was, the directory which is special:

![interesting directory light](/assets/images/boilerctf/interesting_dir_light.png){: .light .w-75 .shadow}
![interesting directory dark](/assets/images/boilerctf/interesting_dir_dark.png){: .dark .w-75 .shadow}

## 7. The interesting file name in the folder?

When opening the folder, we can't find any files:

![directory test light](/assets/images/boilerctf/test_directory_light.png){: .light .w-75 .shadow}
![directory test dark](/assets/images/boilerctf/test_directory_dark.png){: .dark .w-75 .shadow}

And groundhog day...

This time searching for a file. I used more than one wordlist until I get the desired answer:

```bash
gobuster dir -u "http://$target/joomla/_test/" -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-files.txt -o joomla_test_files -t 100 -b 403,404 --exclude-length 320
```
{: .nolineno}

> **All flags explained:**
>
> `-t 100` set to use 100 threads (speeds up the process, but don't use to many)
>
> `-b` block status codes. I don't need 403 or 404 results, there are to many.
>
> `--exclude-length 320` I got a error message on this response length and had to exclude it
{: .prompt-info}

The file in question is found and the content is very interesting:

![file search light](/assets/images/boilerctf/gobuster_filesearch_light.png){: .light .w-100}
![file search dark](/assets/images/boilerctf/gobuster_filesearch_dark.png){: .dark .w-100}

# Questions #2

## 8. Where was the other users pass stored(no extension, just the name)?

Use the credentials found in the previous question and ssh into the target machine.
The answer lays on the `/home/basterd/`{: .filepath} directory.

## 9. user.txt

After getting the second credentials, I ssh into the machine with the user `stoner` and on the home directory, the `user.txt`{: .filepath} can be found. But beware, the files name is not the same as in the question.

## 10. What did you exploit to get the privileged user?

Now searching for a opportunity to escalate privileged, I found the following importent information:
```bash
stoner@Vulnerable:~$ sudo -l
User stoner may run the following commands on Vulnerable:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /NotThisTime/MessinWithYa
```
{: .nolineno}

But this was again a rabbit hole. And yes, I have spare you all the others:

![rabbit holes light](/assets/images/boilerctf/rabbitholes_light.png){: .light}
![rabbit holes dark](/assets/images/boilerctf/rabbitholes_dark.png){: .dark}

So back on searching then. I tend to first check `sudo -l` and right after that, search for `SUID`.
```bash
find / -type f -perm /u=s -user root 2>/dev/null
```
{: .nolineno}

And there is one well known executable which can be used to escalate privilege:
![find suid light](/assets/images/boilerctf/find_suid_light.png){: .light .w-75 .shadow}
![find suid dark](/assets/images/boilerctf/find_suid_dark.png){: .dark .w-75 .shadow}


## 11. root.txt

To be able to read the root flag, I had to escalate privilege to root user by abusing the executable with `SUID` set on.

```bash
/usr/bin/find . -exec /bin/sh -p\; -quit
```

After that command, you will have root access.


Good luck! :)
