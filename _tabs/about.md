My name is Fatos Shala. I did an apprenticeship as a polymechanic, but I already
had a passion for IT back then. After awhile I took the opportunity to get a job
into the IT industry as a «IT Security Engineer». But my goal is to get into the
pentesting/red teaming and one thing on my way to achieve this goal, is THM
and/or HTB. Other cyber techies who also do rooms and boxes in the previous
mentioned services are writing writeups and walkthrough's.

## Reason for this

It happens more than one time that I thought, while reading those writeups, «How
do he/she came up with that?!» and no explanation was given. When I wrote my
first ever writeup for
[AOC 2023 SideQuest](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber23sidequest) I
tried to put everything into the writeup. How I came to this solution or where
do I found those information, when this was not to obvious. But also I put in
all my timewasting errors and
[rabbit holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_rabbit_hole#English_language_uses)
I followed, just to show, that it is normal to take long or to fall for a rabbit
hole. And? I enjoy it! At this moment i decided to make more writeups. But
LinkedIn was not the right place for that. Not only because I cant use markdown
but there was also a problem with the `code-block` feature. The content of those
blocks could not be readed by people who are not logged in to LinkedIn. This was
not acceptable. I thought about to write blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/)
but I haven't made an account there and also the paywall on some articles which
I discovered from time to time, was very unappealing to me. So I decided to use
GitHub where I already had an account. And here we are!

## My Person

I am a person who is very enthusiastic and curious. I like it to be on my
computer, which is a iMac M1 or Macbook Pro M1. I also fall in love with
[Arch Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux) and use it until today
for my homeserver setup. What I like about Arch Linux:

- [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- You will learn much.
- You will start respecting every thing on your computer, because you know now,
  that somebody has to code it to work and there is a
  [daemon](https://itsfoss.com/linux-daemons/) or something running so you can
  enjoy this service.
- You know what you have and what you not have.

But I switched to MacOS because on Linux I wasted a majority of my time in
working on the system instead of working with the system. And no! This dont mean
that Linux isn't working, it is working just fine, but you have so much freedom
and stuff which your little autism can put all the sleeping time into it instead
of going to bed. On MacOS in the other hand, you have a perfect system which
just works and is unix-kind like Linux and it looks also awesome. The lack of
«freedom» in MacOS is just the perfect chain which I need to not waste my time
into thing like: «Oh! The shadow of the context menu is not the exactly same
like that one for the context menu for global menu.» And no, this was not a
small problem. This one cost me the whole night where I solve it instead of
sleeping and resting to work on the next day. After I waste days and nights on
my [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) configuration, I realized what I'm doing to my
self. Now this problem has gone ;) but sometimes I love to login to my Arch
Linux running server and do some stuff.

But I have more than just computing what I love! My family of course and I also
enjoy riding Motorcycle. Beside riding I also like to read about motorcycle and
working on them by myself. My current bike:
[FXDLS 2016](https://womanrider.com/2016/05/2016-harley-davidson-fxdls-low-rider-s-press-launch-unleashing-the-beast/)
Another hobby which fills me with joy is
[Krav Maga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga) and sport in general. But
there is one thing what inspires and motivates me: Stories. They can be in
[live action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action) movies or tv shows but
also anime and manga and of course novels. And ye, I also enjoyed gaming but
this is also very time-consuming and can be addictive, so I stopped gaming at
all.

I like stories where you got a deeper message or where the message is just
perfect wrapped into a storyline. By «deeper meaning» I mean something like:

- [Ghost in the Shell from 1995](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(1995_film)>)
- [Interstellar](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)>)
- [The Buried Giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buried_Giant)

This list is not complete. Just a example from the last of the list:

> “I'm wondering if without our memories, there's nothing for it but for our
> love to fade and die. When it was too late for rescue, it was still early
> enough for revenge. Yet are you so certain, good mistress, you wish to be free
> of this mist? Is it not better some things remain hidden from our minds?”
> <cite>― Kazuo Ishiguro, The Buried Giant ―</cite>

I hope that my love of detail flows into the writeups and that one or two people
find pleasure in my work.

_Thank You for reading!_
